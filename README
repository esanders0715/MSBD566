# MSBD566 - Predictive Modeling and Analytics

This repository contains Assignment 1 for the MSBD566 course at Meharry. The assignment demonstrates data exploration and analysis of Nashvilleâ€™s Air Quality Index (AQI) and pollen data using Python.

## Assignment Overview

### Part 1: Pandas Data Analysis

#### AQI Analysis
- Plot AQI over time
- Plot AQI categories by year (stacked bar chart)
- Count the number of times AQI exceeds 120
- Identify dates when AQI reached "Unhealthy" or worse

#### Pollen Analysis
- Identify the most frequent pollen type
- Visualize pollen frequency using bar charts and scatterplots

#### Comfort Evaluation
- Open-ended discussion: Is Nashville comfortable to live in based on AQI and pollen data?

#### Vectorization Problem
- Compare manual loop vs. pandas groupby().mean() for mean AQI by category
- Measure and compare processing times

### Part 2: GitHub Practice

- Created repository `MSBD566`
- Uploaded notebook, dataset, and this README
- Practiced version control and documentation

## Requirements

- Python 3
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib

To install required packages, run:
